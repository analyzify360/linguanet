# LinguaNet

Welcome to LinguaNet, the cutting-edge translation subnet developed under Commune AI! LinguaNet specializes in **multimodal cross-transform translation** between **text and speech**. This means LinguaNet facilitates seamless communication by allowing text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and language translation in a variety of forms.

## Why LinguaNet Matters

In an increasingly globalized world, effective communication across languages and mediums is essential. LinguaNet offers solutions for:

- **Global Accessibility:** Break language barriers by providing accurate translations for both text and speech.
- **Multimodal Communication:** Enable applications to handle dynamic modes of interaction, such as voice assistants understanding and responding in multiple languages.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Power multilingual customer support systems, enabling businesses to reach diverse audiences.
- **Universal Inclusion:** Provide tools for the hearing or visually impaired by converting speech to text or text to speech.

## How to Run

### Running the Validator

To run the validator, execute:

```bash
python3 -m src.validator.cli <name-of-your-com-key> [--netuid <number>] [--call_timeout <number>] [--use-testnet]
```

### Running the Miner

To run the miner, execute:

```bash
python3 -m src.miner.cli <name-of-your-com-key> [--netuid <number>] [--ip <text>] [--port <number>] [--use-testnet]
```

### Running with PM2

To ensure reliable and continuous execution of your validator or miner using PM2:

1. Install PM2 if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```
2. Start the validator or miner using PM2:
   ```bash
   pm2 start "python3 -m src.validator.cli <name-of-your-com-key> --netuid <number>" --name linguanet-validator
   ```
   ```bash
   pm2 start "python3 -m src.miner.cli <name-of-your-com-key> --netuid <number>" --name linguanet-miner
   ```
3. Monitor your processes:
   ```bash
   pm2 list
   ```

## Device Requirements

### Miner
- Minimum GPU: GeForce RTX 3090 (Memory: 16GB)

### Validator
- Minimum GPU: GeForce RTX 3090 (Memory: 16GB)
- Recommended GPU: NVIDIA RTX A6000 (Memory: 48GB)

## Key Features

### Advanced Translation Models

- **Miner Models:** The default model for miners is `facebook/seamless-M4T-V2-large`, known for its versatility in multilingual and multimodal translation tasks.
- **Query Generation:** Validators generate queries using **LLM models**, specifically `Llama` (with plans to integrate more models in the future).
- **Scoring Mechanism:** Miners are scored based on responses evaluated by `Llama` models, ensuring high-quality and accurate translations.

### Roadmap

We are committed to expanding LinguaNet’s capabilities by integrating additional LLM models and refining the scoring mechanisms to better serve diverse use cases.
